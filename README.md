# Hardware Stuff

#### (updated at 2024-02-20)

Welcome to my repository where I keep track of my hardware stuff. It consists of my gaming PC and the homelab stuff I have going around. This page will be updated when I get any new and shiny hardware or get rid of something.

Adding that having 2 mini pcs with a modern and beefy CPUs really doesn't feel necessary now but I love them, also the NUC was obtained via auction and it was relatively cheap (~200â‚¬)

Got the goated Thinkpad T480 and it's kinda of amazing, the keyboard feels nice and overall a still very powerful machine that can do anything you throw at it!

As for my gaming PC, I've been wanting to upgrade to a 5800X3D but they are still very expensive so I'll probably surrender to get the more modest 5600X if I can find it cheap. 
On another note, I've been using Windows primarly because the Pascal architecture is [basically fucked on Linux](https://libreddit.caldeirag.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/zclxl5/will_vkd3d_ever_be_fixed_on_pascal_gpus/). I'm hoping to adquire a new GPU soon but I really want something modern and cheap :D
